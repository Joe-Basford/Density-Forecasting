    Uncertainty is fundamental in economics. Imperfect or asymmetric information can lead to marked misallocations of resources, and their ubiquity is a hard truth in many economies. Whilst in the past econometricians focused on point and interval forecasts, developments in quantitative finance and risk management have created demand for quick and accurate forecasts of the whole probability distribution. However, accuracy and speed can be conflicting goals, particularly when non-linearities in the data mean complex models are required to accurately predict the probability density function. In this paper, a novel semi-parametric neural network model is developed and compared to a variety of ARMA-GARCH models on the log returns of the NASDAQ composite, Nikkei 225, and DAX stock indices. Using a multivariate version of the Giacomini-White test of equal predictive accuracy \citep{GiacominiWhite,BorupMGW}, a large initial model set of neural network and ARMA-GARCH models is synthesised down to a model confidence set \citep{MCS}. Results indicate that the ARMA-GARCH models outperform the neural network models across all three series, and this result is robust to variations in the testing specification and choice of scoring rule.
