# Old Dogs and New Tricks: Log Return Density Forecasting Using a Novel Neural Network Architecture and ARMA-GARCH Models

This repo is for my final year undergraduate dissertation in economics at the University of Warwick.


My dissertation compares ARMA-GARCH models of order $(p,p)-(p,p)$, for $p=1,2,3,4,5$, with a few variants of a neural network model that I have developed. The comparison of the two model classes follows a similar methodology to Borup et al. (2022), and uses their multivariate Giacomini-White of equal conditional predictive accuracy to construct a model confidence set (Hansen et al., 2011). A high level overview of the methodology is given in the following diagram:
